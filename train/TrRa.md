Prepare your reference model and your aligned model(that you are not satisfied)

For instance, we select DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as our refernece model. We select DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview as our aligned model, which is trained from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B.

Then use our TrRa, detailed information see our paper.
